# Rules

## Clean Code

> Writing clean code means following coding standards, naming conventions, and formatting guidelines to make the code more readable, maintainable, and understandable. It involves practices such as meaningful variable and function names, proper indentation, and consistent code structure.

## S.O.L.I.D.

> S.O.L.I.D. is an acronym for five design principles: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). These principles help in creating modular, scalable, and flexible software designs that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Clean Architecture

> Clean Architecture is an architectural approach that emphasizes separation of concerns and independence of frameworks and libraries. It promotes organizing the codebase into layers, with the inner layers containing business logic and the outer layers containing implementation details and infrastructure concerns. The core principles of Clean Architecture include Dependency Rule, Use Cases, Entities, and Interface Adapters.

## Design Patterns

> Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a template or blueprint for solving specific issues in a consistent and efficient way. Some common design patterns include Singleton, Factory, Builder, Adapter, Observer, Strategy, and Decorator patterns.

## Additional Guidelines

- _Only Generic Components and Utility Functions_: Include only generic components and utility functions to maintain code cleanliness and reusability.

- _Follow Inversion of Control (IoC) Pattern_: Adhere to the Inversion of Control (IoC) pattern to promote decoupling and improve the testability and flexibility of the application.

> These additions emphasize the importance of generic components, utility functions, and adherence to the IoC pattern for maintaining a clean and scalable codebase.
